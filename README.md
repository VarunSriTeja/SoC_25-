# AI/ML Learning Journey: Conceptual Reflection, Progress & Assignments

This repository documents my learning journey across Python, Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), PyTorch, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). It includes a reflection on what I already knew, how much I improved, and the new concepts I learned each week ‚Äî both theoretically and practically.
